# runkeeper-testing

Modified code from [@kylemath](https://github.com/kylemath) for comparing multiple similar length trials of the same distance. 

## Details 
This matlab code works by smoothing the time derivative (smoothLength) of the GPX data and then plotting comparable runs of similar distances on the same plot.

It also adds markers for kilometers and miles. 

It works really well to see the comparison of two (or mulitple) runs, as can be seen right here:
